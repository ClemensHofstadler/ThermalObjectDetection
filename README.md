# Computer-Vision

## Scaling 
all picture was scaled to 454*454 in order to be fed to the system and K which is matrix intrinsic was also scaled by the same amount , other than that Z which was used to calculate the transfer of the data was also scaled by the same amount. 
##  Augmentation
looking at the data it was found the sequence of data is changing with each subfolder exisiting in each folder therefor Augmentation was only done with Flipping image namely, Horizontal, Vertial and Verti-horizontal Flips. 
in order to compennsate for the effect of flipping new Cam parameters considering Rotation was introduced to the system .
